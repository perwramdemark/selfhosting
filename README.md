# üè° My Homelab Setup

This repository documents the containers running in my personal homelab. It includes services for media management, networking, security, notifications, and user interface improvements. All services are containerized and orchestrated using Docker.

<p>This is my home screen in mobile view with most of my apps running.</p>
